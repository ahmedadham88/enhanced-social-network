The British Agricultural Revolution was the unprecedented increase in agricultural production in England due to increases in labor and land productivity that took place between 1750 and 1850, although it had its beginnings in the 17th century. By 1750 agricultural output grew faster than population and the increase in food supply allowed the population of England to exceed 5.5 million for the first time.
