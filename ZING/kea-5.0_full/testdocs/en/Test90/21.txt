The Dutch plow was brought to Britain by Dutch contractors who were hired to drain East Anglican fens and Somerset moors. The plow was extremely successful on wet, boggy soil, but soon was used on ordinary land. It spread to Scotland, America and France. By 1770 it was the cheapest and best plow available.[9
