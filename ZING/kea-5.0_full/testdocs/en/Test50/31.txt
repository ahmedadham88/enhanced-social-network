Legislation regulating middlemen required registration, addressed weights and measures, fixing of prices and collection of tolls by the government. Regulations on markets were eased in 1663 and people were allowed some self regulation to and hold inventory, but it was forbidden to withhold commodities from the market to drive up prices. In the late 18th century the idea of “self regulation” was gaining acceptance.[11]
