The about 77,800,000 acres (about 31,480,000 hectares) of land in Britain pre-1922 varied considerably in arability. England had about 30% arable land with Wales, Scotland and Ireland favouring raising livestock and dairy farming with only about 3%, 7% and 15% arable land respectively. Nearly all of Britain is less than 75 miles (121 km) from the ocean and many communities have close ties to fishing and trade. Nearly all farmers kept livestock as well as growing crops on arable land for their own food and a small extra amount to trade with the towns people for goods they couldn't or didn't have time to make. The livestock were almost a necessity as they could eat pasture during the day and spread some of their manure over arable or fallow land during the night if a crop was not planted there yet. During the winter when they were fed and housed their manure built up around the stock pens and was usually hauled out in the spring and spread on the grain fields before they were ploughed. To help keep the land productive manure or other plant matter had to be spread on the soil by the livestock or the farmer regularly to maintain the plant nutrient levels needed to grow wheat, oats, rye and barley. Barley was grown primarily to be brewed into beer, but it was also eaten, usually in dish called "pottage".[1] The water in this time period (before germs were known or water treatment plants) was so unsafe that beer was a very common beverage drunk by nearly allâ€”children included. Oats, rye and wheat were primarily used in cereals and breads, but these grains were also used in pottage (this staple dish for the poor also included seasonal vegetables and could include pulses and bits of meat). The productivity of the farms gradually increased as a larger fraction moving to the cities left fewer farmers to grow more and larger crops.
