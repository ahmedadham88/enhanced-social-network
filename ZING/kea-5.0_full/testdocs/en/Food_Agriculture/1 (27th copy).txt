Mexico produces most of the world's avocado,[29] and avocado is one of the primary cultivars for export, the eighth cultivar by production volume. In 2013 the total area dedicated to avocado production was 168,155 hectares (415,520 acres), and the harvest was of 1,109,814 tonnes.[30] The states that produce the most are MÃ©xico, Morelos, Nayarit, Puebla, and Michoacan which accounts for 86% of the total.[31] In Michoacan the cultivation is complicated by the existence of drug cartels that extort protection fees from cultivators. They are reported to exact 2000 Mexican pesos per hectar from avocado farmers and an additional 1 to 3 pesos per kilo of harvested fruit.[32]
