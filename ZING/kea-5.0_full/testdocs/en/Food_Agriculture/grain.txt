The Canadian Grain Commission, also known as the CGC, is a Canadian government department responsible for regulation of the grain handling industry.

The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-food is responsible for the Canadian Grain Commission.

The Commission is governed by the Canada Grain Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. G-10) which provides for the appointment of three commissioners by the federal cabinet, one of whom is named chief commissioner.

Its headquarters are located in Winnipeg Manitoba. As of 2010, the commission has three regional offices which provide a full range of inspection, weighing, analytical, and entomology services, namely, Thunder Bay, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec, and Vancouver, B.C.
