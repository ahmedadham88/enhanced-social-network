The word "avocado" comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl [aːˈwakat͡ɬ],[8] which goes back to the proto-Aztecan *pa:wa which also meant "avocado".[9] Sometimes the Nahuatl word was used with the meaning "testicle", probably because of the likeness between the fruit and the bodypart.[10] In other Spanish-speaking countries it is known by the Mexican name and in Portuguese it is abacate. The fruit is sometimes called an avocado pear or alligator pear (due to its shape and the rough green skin of some cultivars). The Nahuatl ahuacatl can be compounded with other words, as in ahuacamolli, meaning avocado soup or sauce, from which the Spanish word guacamole derives.[11]
