The avocado was introduced from Mexico to California in the 19th century, and has become a successful cash crop. About 59,000 acres (240 km2) – some 95% of United States avocado production – is located in Southern California, with 60% in San Diego County.[26][27] Fallbrook, California, claims the title of "Avocado Capital of the World" (also claimed by the town of Uruapan, Michoacán, México[28]), and both Fallbrook and Carpinteria, California, host annual avocado festivals.
