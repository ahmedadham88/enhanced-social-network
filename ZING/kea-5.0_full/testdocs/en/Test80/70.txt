Populations before 1700 are somewhat speculative.
Population changes in %/year are tentative before 1700.
The Black Death starting in about 1349 is thought to have
reduced the population by 30–50%. The increases in population
since 1800 have grown too fast to avoid famine without
more productive agriculture and extensive imports. Fortunately,
the Industrial Revolutions products could be easily traded
for other countries surplus agricultural products.
B: About 40–50% of Britain's food is now imported.
