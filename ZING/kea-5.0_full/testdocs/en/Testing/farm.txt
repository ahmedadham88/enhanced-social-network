In the United States, there are over three million migrant and seasonal farmworkers; 72% are foreign-born, 78% are male, they have an average age of 36 and average education of 8 years.[11] Farmworkers make an average hourly rate of $9-10 per hour, compared to an average of over $18 per hour for nonfarm labor. Their average family income is under $20,000 and 23% live in families with incomes below the federal poverty level.[12] One-half of all farmworker families earn less than $10,000 per year,[13] which is significantly below the 2005 U.S. poverty level of $19,874 for a family of four.
