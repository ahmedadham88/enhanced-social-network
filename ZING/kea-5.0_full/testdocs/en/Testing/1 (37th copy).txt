On the other hand, the botanical sense of fruit includes many structures that are not commonly called fruits, such as bean pods, corn kernels, wheat grains, and tomatoes.[2][3]The section of a fungus that produces spores is also called a fruiting body.[4] A fruit results from maturation of one or more flowers, and the gynoecium of the flower(s) forms all or part of the fruit.[9]Inside the ovary/ovaries are one or more ovules where the megagametophyte contains the egg cell.[10] After double fertilization, these ovules will become seeds. The ovules are fertilized in a process that starts with pollination, which involves the movement of pollen from the stamens to the stigma of flowers. After pollination, a tube grows from the pollen through the stigma into the ovary to the ovule and two sperm are transferred from the pollen to the megagametophyte. Within the megagameto
