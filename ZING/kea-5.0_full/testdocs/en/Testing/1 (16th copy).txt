The modern English name is not etymologically related to the similar sounding Spanish word abogado, meaning 'lawyer' (as in advocate), but comes through an English rendering of the Spanish "aguacate" as "avogato". The earliest known written use in English is attested from 1697 as "Avogato Pear", a term which was later corrupted as "alligator pear".[12] Because the word avogato sounded like "advocate" several languages reinterpreted it to have that meaning and "advocate"-forms of the word appear in several other Germanic languages, such as the German Advogato-Birne, the Swedish advokatpäron, the old Danish advokat-pære (today it is called "avocado") and the Dutch advocaatpeer.[13] It is known as "butter fruit" in parts of India.[14] In eastern China it is known as è lí (鳄梨, a direct translation of "alligator pear") or huángyóu guǒ (黄油果, "butter fruit").
