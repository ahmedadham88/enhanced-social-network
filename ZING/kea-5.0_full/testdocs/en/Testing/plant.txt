Learn about how plants grow by experimenting with this interactive science activity. Using heat & water, see if you can make the plant grow to a healthy size. Too much sun & moisture can have a negative effect on the plant though so be careful when giving it nutrients. Keep the amounts in balance and see how long you can keep the plant growing healthily. Experiment with different conditions, what does closing the blinds and removing the sunlight do? What happens if you forget to water the plant or add too much water? How about if the conditions become too hot or too cold? Can you take care of the plant for 4 weeks? Take up the challenge and give it a try. This fun, educational game is perfect for kids.
