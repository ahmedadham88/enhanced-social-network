The university lifestyle often requires students to juggle work, classes, friends and family. The juggling act gets even harder during midterms and finals when there is an exam in every class and a stack of assignments due. With such busy schedules sleep is often given low priority, although sleep is necessary to maintaining overall wellness. When walking around campus it is not uncommon to find a student catching a quick nap as the opportunity presents itself.
