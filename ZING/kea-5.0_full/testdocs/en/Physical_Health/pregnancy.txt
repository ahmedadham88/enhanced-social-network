Do you think you might be pregnant? Is your period late? Don’t panic yet - irregular periods are common. Stress, fatigue and other physical and psychological factors can all cause a delay in your period.

If you think you might be pregnant, the first thing to do is find out for sure. See our Am I pregnant? section for information about how to confirm a pregnancy.

If you know you’re pregnant, you probably have lots of questions. See our I’m pregnant, now what? section for information about your options.

Whether you know you’re pregnant or just think you might be, it’s important to talk with a trusted adult like your parent or doctor. You can also call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868 and talk to one of our counsellors.
