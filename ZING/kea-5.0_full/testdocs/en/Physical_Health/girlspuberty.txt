Puberty is the term used to describe the time when your body is changing from the body of a child to the body of an adult. This process begins earlier in girls than in boys, usually between ages 8 and 13 and it lasts 2 to 4 years.

Physical changes and emotional changes are a big part of puberty. You’ll find that you develop at a different rate from your friends – so don’t worry if you’re the only girl you know who is/isn’t wearing a bra or if you’re the shortest/tallest in your class. Your development during puberty is unique and right for you.

If you want more information on puberty and the changes happening to your body, talk to a trusted adult or call Kids Help Phone at 1-800-668-6868 and talk to one of our professional counsellors.
